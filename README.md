# Code Blue
Code Blue is a mental health app for YC students. (CAS Project 2020)

The focus of project is on alleviating academic stress, raising awareness about mental health and promoting stronger bonds within the school community

Aims:
* Raise recognition on mental health issues
* Improve the lives of students within school through the app and the Choco Project
* Destigmatize mental health issues and to encourage students to have fun

## Overview

We aim to create an app to help students at YC deal with stress. In this app, we will include meditation recordings from Mr C., a scheduling feature to remind students not to procrastinate, counsellors’ contacts and mental health hotlines, and the option to message the Code Blue team to participate in the “Choco Project”. The aim of the app is to give students a tool in their everyday lives to manage their mental health.

## Development

Code Blue is designed to run on iOS platforms, primarily on iPhones. The UI layout was designed on Figma, and the prototype can be viewed at: https://www.figma.com/file/IXyJRs2XBycFgbSsQM7iLD/CODE-BLUE?node-id=0%3A1 

The app itself is being developed in Swift 5 through Xcode.
